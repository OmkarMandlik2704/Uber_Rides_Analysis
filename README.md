# Uber_Rides_Analysis
The Uber Data Analysis Project explores ride trends using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. It analyzes cancellations, ride demand, revenue, and ratings, identifying key patterns like peak bookings on weekends and UPI preference. Future work includes machine learning for demand prediction and pricing optimization.
Overview
The Uber Data Analysis Project aims to derive insights from ride data using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization. The project focuses on understanding customer behavior, driver performance, booking trends, and revenue patterns to enhance decision-making. By analyzing cancellation rates, ride volumes, payment methods, and customer satisfaction, this project provides actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and user experience.

1. Objectives:
Maintain customer cancellations below 7% and driver cancellations under 18%
Reduce incomplete rides to less than 6%
Boost ride volume on weekends and match days
Optimize order value distribution based on peak times
Identify top customers, popular vehicle types, and ride distance trends.

3. Tech Stack:
SQL – Data extraction, querying, and aggregation
Power BI – Interactive dashboards and data visualization
Python (Optional) – Additional data processing and analysis.

3 Key Data Points:
The dataset includes attributes such as:
i.Booking ID, Status, Date & Time
ii. Customer & Driver Ratings
iii. Payment Methods & Revenue Metrics
iv. Ride Distance & Vehicle Type
v. Cancellation & Incomplete Ride Reasons

4: SQL-Based Insights
This project includes SQL queries to analyze:

Successful bookings and canceled rides by customers and drivers
Top 5 customers by ride volume
Average ride distance per vehicle type
Revenue breakdown by payment method
Total booking value of completed rides.

5: Power BI Dashboards
The Power BI dashboard provides:
i.Ride Volume Over Time 
ii.Booking Status Breakdown 
iii.Top Vehicle Types by Distance 
iv.Revenue by Payment Method 
v.Customer vs. Driver Ratings .

 6:Key Findings
i.Majority of customers prefer UPI payments
ii.Peak ride volume occurs on weekends and match days
iii.Higher-rated drivers complete more rides
iv.Premium ride bookings correlate with better customer ratings.
